This initiative by MIT greatly benefits students such as myself by providing access to relevant material from a highly reputed institute. The result is an increase in the quality of our knowledge and research, and in the credibility of our papers. I truly appreciate the generosity of MIT and hope that other institutes and universities will follow your example. Hopefully, this could lead to the emergence of an open network of knowledge-sharing\u2026.",

That changed when I (accidently) learned about the open access policy of MIT. I was desperately looking for some historical data on population. After long hours of fruitless search, I returned to Daron Acemoglu's page, and voila, I got more than what I was hoping for. Reading the fascinating research that is being done in my area of interest, and especially having the opportunity to access all the datasets, has  enormously helped me in my research. It is a blessing indeed. Thanks again."

There are two reasons for this. Firstly the volume of material that one needs to access is large. Secondly, one cannot be absolutely certain of wishing to study a particular paper in until one has browsed it, as abstracts don't always give a clear enough indication. So one would rapidly incur a substantial expenditure. The DeepDyve facility alleviates this to a degree but it still remains very expensive for an individual. Its also very irritating, having provided services as an author and referee to these scientific journals free of charge not to be able to gain access, to say nothing of the public expenditure that enables the content to be created.",

            "I am a 2nd year post graduate student on nanoscience in Greece, in parallel with my psychiatric residence training. MIT Open Access articles and MIT open courses have been most important for me in terms of basic education on science and in terms of scientific writing guidelines.  \n\nIn Greece, we have to overcome the major problem of inadequate funding for public libraries, which keeps us about a year back compared to the rest of the developed countries due to the financial crisis that harasses our society and its institutions and academic facilities. So, any kind of open access is of paramount value for us, as we struggle to retain the very high scientific standards that have been reached by many of our labs and courses the last 20 years. \n\nI would like to thank you for any kind of open access document that you provide for the global scientific community. Also, I would like to ask for any kind of help for the Greek scientific community in terms of co-operation, local projects and scientific teaching. \n"

I'm on other committees also, probably, and hopefully only initially, because they needed female representation. Several of my colleagues and I have been asked to steer a series of articles on Women in Plastic Surgery. This article is very helpful as it hits many of the topics germane to women in my specialty. I'm especially amused/dismayed/frustrated/validated by women who approach me, shocked (shocked!) that discrimination and bias are happening to them, too.

I think OA has helped me and him by making his work easy to find and access.\nBut the bulk of the research I do for work includes papers in OA.  I probably have 20-30 downloaded to read at any one time -- and I'm not a hard-core researcher.  OA makes this knowledge readily available to the non-academic, technical, and even semi-technical audience.\nThe value for me is twofold: some ideas are directly implementable from OA papers -- that's a huge win, since we don't have to reinvent the wheel.  The other value is it gives us context, so we know whether we're onto something, reinventing wheels, out on the bleeding edge, or way behind the times.  It's saved me more time and money than I can even imagine, by preventing us from running down rabbit holes.\nSo thank you.  It's a great service to me personally, and definitely the world at large.",

In the past few months I have had back muscle injury that leads me to think about this project of how to help other swimmers to detect possible injuries. To begin with, together with my dad, we have created a small electronic device that measures electric resistance of the human muscles. We tried to apply DC current and failed. But, after we switched to AC current (500Hz to 30KHz), we saw results similar to what the authors described in this article. I was very excited about results described in this article so want to get in touch with this people and tell about my experience. Also, since I am thinking about my future path, I like to see what kind of things MIT does. Also, my teacher suggested I choose this project as my HS Senior project. I would appreciate if you put me in contact with the authors or with someone who I can talk to\n", 
            "This is truly *wonderful*!! I am an independent researcher doing paid work and also volunteer work at community labs with people of all ages including many high school students. As such, I have only limited \"free\" access to papers behind paywalls. At $ 30-40 apiece it is impractical and expensive to buy papers based on nothing but an abstract. Further, it would cost thousands to subscribe to all the necessary journals.\n\nOpen Access is what all of us need to research, discover and invent so that humanity may achieve a better future. Part of my work is to inspire young students. More than ever before it is important to enable people outside of academia and large institutions to access cutting edge research. The problems facing us as a society and as a species are multidisciplinary. The more people we have working on them, the better.\n\nYes, someone must bear the publication and review costs. This is a proper use of grants and research funds, most of which come directly or indirectly from the public, including the financial help that parents provide to both undergrad and grad students:-). This is a strong argument that the results should be publicly available and not behind pricey paywalls. In some instances, patent and licensing fees can also compensate, but only if the research is used and sold. The best way to realize this is share it up front and encourage people to apply it in beneficial ways.", 
            "On September 14, 2015, our species developed new eyes--a new way to experience the world. My thanks to the faculty at MIT for making the details of this development available to all of us. Personally, 40 years ago, I studied GR at CCNY. For a brief time I even studied under Michio Kaku. I loved the elegance of the wave solution to the field equations. However, I deserted my first love to attend the demands of biological necessity. But, I am thankful that I have lived long enough to see the waves I imaged ripple through observational reality. Reading this paper erases 40 years (for a few minutes). My hope is that through this paper, some young Galileo will defer the biological necessity to baste in this new light.\n",

I'm giving a comprehensive talk that includes feedback from our students but also covers things like Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias.  Having the full text of your research available has been very helpful to me.  I'm used to talking about this with friends who don't believe discrimination or bias exists, so I'm making sure all of my points are backed by peer reviewed research.  Thank you.",

            "When I heard of the LIGO gravity wave detection, all I could find were these general articles, but no real details of the detection. Only through the open access I got from the notification I got from MIT was I able to quickly get the article and share it with my dissident science group which has a weekly conference call. Our 2-hour discussion today 2/15/16 centered around that article and it was very helpful for everyone to have access to the complete article instead of just overviews from other mainstream articles. It is frustrating that when one of our participants wanted to get the references for 97.98 and 99, I told him he could do that through the internet, but at a cost of $25 or he would have to visit a public university (which he could not because of disability). This type of government publicly funded research should be freely accessible and not be behind an absurd  $25-$40 per article barrier. Thank you for doing the right thing and making this very significant discovery as a freely available article.\n",

As an undergraduate researcher, I have to search through multiple libraries and online resources to be able to access required information for my research. This article, which I was able to download quite easily though the website, was very helpful in creating my literature review of Shared Autonomous Vehicles. I could not have been able to comprehend and cite the results of this study without the access to the article, and I am grateful for providing me the same."
