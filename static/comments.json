This initiative by MIT greatly benefits students such as myself by providing access to relevant material from a highly reputed institute. The result is an increase in the quality of our knowledge and research, and in the credibility of our papers. I truly appreciate the generosity of MIT and hope that other institutes and universities will follow your example. Hopefully, this could lead to the emergence of an open network of knowledge-sharing\u2026.",

That changed when I (accidently) learned about the open access policy of MIT. I was desperately looking for some historical data on population. After long hours of fruitless search, I returned to Daron Acemoglu's page, and voila, I got more than what I was hoping for. Reading the fascinating research that is being done in my area of interest, and especially having the opportunity to access all the datasets, has  enormously helped me in my research. It is a blessing indeed. Thanks again."

            "I have a full-time job entirely unrelated to film studies, but occasionally write academic papers for publishing. I cannot gain access to closed articles through my work, I have no student access and am not in a financial position to pay for each individual article on the off chance that it may be of use to me. I rely on open access archives like this to be able to continue with what is essentially a hobby for me, and appreciate very much that these resources enable me to do so. Thank you very much!", 
            "The article I\u2019m reading directly impacts my [global climate] research\u2026. The information in this article is very important for me because it indicates that there is a way to generate a more accurate age model for ferromanganese crusts.",

            "Being a retired academic, but still active, I rely on open access material, as I don't now have access to journals, for licencing reasons, and it is far too expensive to purchase copies on-line. There are two reasons for this. Firstly the volume of material that one needs to access is large. Secondly, one cannot be absolutely certain of wishing to study a particular paper in until one has browsed it, as abstracts don't always give a clear enough indication. So one would rapidly incur a substantial expenditure. The DeepDyve facility alleviates this to a degree but it still remains very expensive for an individual. Its also very irritating, having provided services as an author and referee to these scientific journals free of charge not to be able to gain access, to say nothing of the public expenditure that enables the content to be created.", 
            "I'm researching a PhD (part time) related to Human Factors (HF) in blood transfusion. I have extensive knowledge of transfusion, but very limited knowledge of HF.

I have downloaded a couple of MIT 'author's last manuscript' articles which have been invaluable. Many thanks.",

            "I have been tasked with turning around a department that cannot retain diversity in its senior management and is increasingly becoming homogenous. I've come across this idea that a meritocracy advantages males and disadvantages females and I'd like to see if it is relevant for us. Without valid research, as opposed to anecdote or personal narrative, selection of a path forward will be based on existing unconscious assumption and possible bias.", 
            "I run a boutique wellbeing consultancy in London, UK. I am particularly interested in psychology and neuroscience and its interrelationship with happiness and wellbeing. I recently pulled together a training video on unconscious/implicit bias and used Jensen's 2012 study, \"Nonconscious Activation of Placebo and Nocebo Pain Responses,\" to highlight just how powerful our subconscious mind can be at distorting our perception of reality, based on preconditioned associations, and how similar mechanisms are at play in implicit bias in our day-to-day lives.

Many other institutions only publish results but the insights gained from reading the actual ideas behind the results is invaluable to me. Also this is perfect for self-study, which I like. I am interested in the control of legged robots and today there are not really books on that subject, the theory is not there yet. That means the only way to learn something about it is by reading the current research documentation. Thus making that available is great!  "

MIT Open Access articles and MIT open courses have been most important for me in terms of basic education on science and in terms of scientific writing guidelines. In Greece, we have to overcome the major problem of inadequate funding for public libraries, which keeps us about a year back compared to the rest of the developed countries due to the financial crisis that harasses our society and its institutions and academic facilities. So, any kind of open access is of paramount value for us, as we struggle to retain the very high scientific standards that have been reached by many of our labs and courses the last 20 years. I would like to thank you for any kind of open access document that you provide for the global scientific community.",

The paper I found written by Samuels, Richard J., and Narushige Michishita, titled \"Hugging and Hedging: Japanese Grand Strategy in the 21st Century,\" really helps me when I explain briefly about Japan's hedging strategy. If the gentlemen who wrote this are still in contact with you, please send them my sincere thank you."

I have ended up on several committees in national societies partially because of my gender: Diversity (Am Soc for Surg of the Hand) and Women in Plastic Surgery Steering Committee (Am Soc of Plastic Surg). I'm on other committees also, probably, and hopefully only initially, because they needed female representation. Several of my colleagues and I have been asked to steer a series of articles on Women in Plastic Surgery. This article is very helpful as it hits many of the topics germane to women in my specialty. I'm especially amused/dismayed/frustrated/validated by women who approach me, shocked (shocked!) that discrimination and bias are happening to them, too. They suddenly realize that women who notice and mention it aren't necessarily hypersensitive fragile flowers.",

I told my CEO I was willing to work on issues around diversity and he charged me to come forward with my ideas.  I am using this article to better ground myself in the literature around meritocracy and bias to present an argument to the CEO about why we have to acknowledge our implicit biases in our meritocratic organization.",

            "I read OA articles all the time when researching new ideas. The value for me is twofold: some ideas are directly implementable from OA papers -- that's a huge win, since we don't have to reinvent the wheel. The other value is it gives us context, so we know whether we're onto something, reinventing wheels, out on the bleeding edge, or way behind the times.  It's saved me more time and money than I can even imagine, by preventing us from running down rabbit holes. So thank you.  It's a great service to me personally, and definitely the world at large.",

            "I am current a 10th grade student from the Seattle area. I am currently trying to find a way of diagnosing muscle injuries in swimmers. In the past few months I have had back muscle injury that leads me to think about this project of how to help other swimmers to detect possible injuries. To begin with, together with my dad, we have created a small electronic device that measures electric resistance of the human muscles. We tried to apply DC current and failed. But, after we switched to AC current (500Hz to 30KHz), we saw results similar to what the authors described in this article. I was very excited about results described in this article so want to get in touch with this people and tell about my experience. ", 
            "This is truly wonderful!! I am an independent researcher doing paid work and also volunteer work at community labs with people of all ages including many high school students. As such, I have only limited \"free\" access to papers behind paywalls. At $30-40 apiece it is impractical and expensive to buy papers based on nothing but an abstract. Further, it would cost thousands to subscribe to all the necessary journals. Open access is what all of us need to research, discover and invent so that humanity may achieve a better future. Part of my work is to inspire young students. More than ever before it is important to enable people outside of academia and large institutions to access cutting edge research. The problems facing us as a society and as a species are multidisciplinary. The more people we have working on them, the better.", 
            "On September 14, 2015, our species developed new eyes--a new way to experience the world. My thanks to the faculty at MIT for making the details of this development available to all of us. Personally, 40 years ago, I studied GR at CCNY. For a brief time I even studied under Michio Kaku. I loved the elegance of the wave solution to the field equations. However, I deserted my first love to attend the demands of biological necessity. But, I am thankful that I have lived long enough to see the waves I imaged ripple through observational reality. Reading this paper erases 40 years (for a few minutes). My hope is that through this paper, some young Galileo will defer the biological necessity to baste in this new light.\n",

I am very pleased to have access to this paper. It is SUCH a bummer to be surfing the web and find papers behind paywalls. I will not risk $41 that someone's paper will be so great as to be worth that much money. I make sure that legal preprints of all of my papers are openly available on my web site.",

It has made me think about some of the same analog problems with my domain in a different way.\n", 
            "Thank you. I'm a 60-year-old retired female scientist from a field different than physics but have recently become profoundly interested in quantum gravity and unification. Open access makes it much easier for me to get these papers. I can surely drive to the University of Arizona, which is about 45 minutes from my home, and use their library to access these papers. Still, it's difficult because I often find references in one paper that take me to another and then I'm again driving down to UofA. It becomes a job driving there and back, over and over, and I lose the thread of what I was interested in.",
