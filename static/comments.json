The result is an increase in the quality of our knowledge and research, and in the credibility of our papers. I truly appreciate the generosity of MIT and hope that other institutes and universities will follow your example. Hopefully, this could lead to the emergence of an open network of knowledge-sharing\u2026",

That changed when I (accidently) learned about the open access policy of MIT. I was desperately looking for some historical data on population. After long hours of fruitless search, I returned to Daron Acemoglu's page, and Voila, I got more than what I was hoping for. Reading the fascinating research that is being done in my area of interest, and especially having the opportunity to access all the datasets has  enormously helped me in my research. It is a blessing indeed. Thanks again."

Secondly, one cannot be absolutely certain of wishing to study a particular paper in until one has browsed it, as abstracts don't always give a clear enough indication. So one would rapidly incur a substantial expenditure. The DeepDyve facility alleviates this to a degree but it still remains very expensive for an individual. Its also very irritating, having provided services as an author and referee to these scientific journals free of charge not to be able to gain access, to say nothing of the public expenditure that enables the content to be created."
